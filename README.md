Project Description
This project is purely aimed for fun and entertainment.we have created a random brainrot website for people to kill time without doing anything productive or usefull.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
All the ways to kill boredom are always very conservative like games that has scorecards and time restrictions. But what if there is a random website to pass time by simply clicking a mouse and thinking no more.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our website has a home page wherein there are 3 water drops to click. once you click on any one of them it explodes.
When you click the first one you are redirected to another page where you can split water bubbles endlessly. You can do nothing but keep on splitting water drops untill you are goood.
When you click the second one you are redirected to a fluid simulator wherein simply dragging the mouse gives you colourful watersplashes in the screen. 
When you click the third one you are redirected to a page wherein you are asked to catch a button that you never can.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

This website is a multi-page front-end project featuring interactive, intentionally useless web experiences. It demonstrates creativity in browser-based animation, interactivity, and event handling using the following:

* *HTML5* â€” Used for structuring the different mini-pages (index.html, bubble.html, fluid_simulator.html, mouse.html).
* *CSS3* â€” Styled with inline <style> tags using gradients, shadows, transitions, and absolute positioning.
* *Vanilla JavaScript* â€” Handles all interactivity and animation logic. No external libraries or frameworks are used.

 *Page-wise Breakdown*

#### index.html â€” Home Page

* Displays a playful, stylized UI inspired by Studio Ghibli.
* Buttons link to different pages of the project.
* Basic flexbox for layout and hover animations.

#### bubble.html â€” Repelling Button Game

* A button repels away from the cursor using trigonometric vector math and DOM manipulation.
* Uses mousemove events to track user movement.
* Edge-detection triggers a "shake" animation when the button is cornered.

#### fluid_simulator.html â€” Fake Fluid Swirl

* Particle system rendered on a full-screen <canvas>.
* On mousemove or touchmove, colorful particles are spawned and move with a decaying velocity, simulating a fluid effect.
* Uses RGBA and globalAlpha to create fading trails.
* No physics engine â€” all behavior is simulated manually.

#### mouse.html â€” (Pending your code to describe this)

[Languages used]NIL
[Frameworks used]HTML5,CSS3, Vanilla Javascript
